# Firebase Web Codelab - Final code

This folder contains the final code of the [Firebase Web Codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/).

You can use this app directly if you'd like to see the finished app but before you do follow the [Create a Firebase Project and Setup](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#3) step of the Codelab instructions

If you'd like to follow the step by step codelab start with the [web-start](../web-start) directory.

##Setup instructions
Note: All these commands should be run from inside the codelab folder. Find out where you are by typing: `pwd`, which stands for print working directory.

`git clone https://github.com/mjchristy/codelab.git`

2. Compile the site
// Be sure you're in the "codelab" folder.
`npm install && npm run start`
Leave this running in a tab

3. View the site locally
// Open a new terminal tab
